# To Do (one day, or not)

* Increase time between update.  
Currently, update every heartbeat (30 secondes) but write in Domoticz database every 5 minutes only.  
One update every minute (or every 5 minutes ??) should be enough.

* Use data 'today_energy' and 'month_energy'.

* Found a clean way to deal with situations where smartplug is disconnected (and not just in off state).

* Rewrite from scratch, using template if needed.  
I don't fully understand the heartbeat method used by 593304.
